With this we are presenting a additive sound synthesis Pure Data External. Alongside we provide a fun demonstration of controlling it by using smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data from a smartphone ~\newline

The repo consist of the external\textquotesingle{}s source code in addition with other needed c files, the pd external binary (Mac\+OS x64) and two sample patches to use it with \href{http://danomatika.com/code/pdparty/guide}{\texttt{ Pd\+Party}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Requirements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In order to use the addsi$\sim$ external from {\bfseries{External Binary and Help Patch}} you either need to have a Mac\+Os running on a 64 bit machine, or you build the external yourself using the provided {\bfseries{External\textquotesingle{}s Source}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Using addsi$\sim$ with Pd\+Party}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
addsi was created to be used with your smartphone! How to?
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download \href{http://danomatika.com/code/pdparty/guide}{\texttt{ Pd\+Party}} (i\+OS) or \href{http://droidparty.net}{\texttt{ Droid\+Party}} (Android) and see how they work
\item Grab the smartphone patch from {\bfseries{Sample Patches}} and move it to your device and start it.
\item Tap the buttons to send O\+SC messages containing accelerometer and gyroscope data. Make sure to set the host IP correctly in the O\+SC settings, to match the IP adress of you computer!

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Start the addsi$\sim$patch.pd from {\bfseries{Sample Patches}} on your computer
\item Have fun!
